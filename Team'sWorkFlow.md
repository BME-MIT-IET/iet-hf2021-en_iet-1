# The team's workflow :

We started by analysing the project's structure and its features, so we could find some weaknesses and plan to improve them with the relevant tools , this has been done with having daily meetings and equaily distributed daily tasks. 

Based on the initial program structure we decided to use CI, static techniques, and testing methods to  analyze the performance of the project for this purpose we planned  to use : 
- JUnit testing, to test individual units of the code.
- SonarCloud  & jacoco, to Check the progress of the development and the parts we could improve plus the coverage of the test cases.
- Github Issues, to review each other work and share our opinion.

- Maven, handeling the dependencies and managing the projects . 
# work distibution :
After We first selected our leader of the group that is responsible for the workflow, we distributed our work based on our knowledge and our time, each member of the team was tasked with one or two topic which he can do and learn about, and then share the knowledge and job done during our daily meeting to the other group, which they can check out and assess (eg approve the pull request, or rise an issue )


 # Team dynamics :

After we formed the team, we started planning on how we should tackle the task so that everyone is involved, and everyone is sharing their expertise regarding the techniques we will need to use. We mainly used GitHub for our planning. through, Github wiki, github issues, kanaban board. We mainly used Kanban board for our workflow, to separete out tasks into different catagories (to do, in progress, done and so on) we could also link our issues and pull request to it so we can have a better communication within the team. 



After our discussions and decisions we had to start learning about some of the techniques. (Maven, sonarCloud, JaCoCo..)



we also had a process of peer-learning, which we assigned each individual in the team with a task of learning the tools which we would like to use in our project.

Then each member of the team had to present what they have learned and teach the others about what have they learned and how the tools should be used in the project.


# continues reviews :
We would have daily meeting everyday, as we wanted to make the maximum of continues integration so each day we would assign daily tasks to the each group or individual in the group and in the next dady we would review them in github and
if there is an issue with any part completed task or any part of it needs improvment we used the comment and issues on github so the group/individual would know which part has to be changed or improved
